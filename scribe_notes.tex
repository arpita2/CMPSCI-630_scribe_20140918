\section{Review of Custom Allocators}

We reviewed per-class allocators, custom pattern allocators, and
region allocators from last lecture.

\section{CISC vs. RISC}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item CISC Complex Instruction Set Computer. A current example is x86.
	\item RISC Reduced Instruction Set Computer. A current example is ARM.
	\item There is no technical definition of either, but RISCs have a uniform instruction size while
		CISCs are often variable.
	\item With CISCs, it is difficult to differentiate between code and data, which is inherently insecure.
		Some examples of exploits are:
		\begin{description}
			\item[Drive-By malware] Visit a web page with your browser. The browser downloads JavaScipt
				with embedded x86 code. Computer executes code through buffer overflow.
			\item[Morris worm] Self-replicating malware created by Robert Morris took down the internet
				in 1988. Morris was convicted of a felony and is now a professor at MIT.
		\end{description}
	\item x86 is by the most well known CISC.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Examples of complex x86 instruction sets:
				\begin{description}
					\item[SIMD] Single Instruction Multiple Data such as vector operations
					\item[MIMD] Multiple Instruction Multiple Data
				\end{description}
			\item Why has Intel's x86 continued to be so popular?
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Intel makes really good silicon. The $n$ in their $n$ nm process continues
						to decrease, which is the distance between traces on their chips. This makes
						their chips faster, regardless of instruction set.
					\item They started from scratch, teaming up with HP to make the Itanium, which is
						RISC like. It used very long instruction words (VLIWs) and relied on compiler
						optimization, which did not work.
					\item Although it easier to write a complier for reduced instruction sets, compiler
						writers are an insignificant portion of a processor maker's market.
					\item Intel's complex instruction set is only an interface whose operations are
						implemented in RISC like micro-ops or hardware. This is not a leaky abstraction.
						It allows Intel to introduce a complex instruction implemented in micro-ops
						and switch to a hardware implementation in later generations. There is a compiler
						on chip.
				\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Coprocessor evolution
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The industry often creates discrete processors for specialized tasks that are eventually
				incorporated into the CPU.
			\item Examples:
				\begin{description}
					\item[FPU] The Intel 8087 math coprocessor or floating point unit was an optional processor
						that shared memory with the 8088 CPU and was located in a socket next to it.
					\item[GPU] Graphics cards contain GPUs, but GPUs are often now included in the CPU.
					\item[Other examples] Translation lookaside buffer (TLB) and vector machines
				\end{description}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Loop unrolling is process of replacing jumps with repeated code. It results in less
		condition checking and more instruction level parallelism extraction.
\end{enumerate}
